\section*{Extra Credit Puzzle}

Given the scenario described in the homework, namely that we have four people who have to cross a bridge, the bridge can only hold two people, and there is a flashlight which each group of 1 or 2 must carry with them. The group must all be across within 17 minutes. Each person will take a different amount of time to cross the bridge once:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l r}
	\centering
	Son & 1 min \\
	Father & 2 min \\
	Grandfather & 5 min \\
	Great-grandfather & 10 min \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | c}
	The father and son cross & 2 min \\
	The son returns & 1 min \\
	The grandfather and great-grandfather cross & 10 min \\
	The father returns & 2 min \\
	The father and son cross the bridge as the flashlight grows dim & 2 min \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Total time} & 17 min
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
