\section*{Problem 6}

In this problem we are constructing a prototype which can be used to force the 3-Coloring Backtracking Algorithm to take exponential time to discover that it is not 3-Colorable.
\\
\\
The idea is as follows: Construct a graph of $n$ nodes where $V_n$ and $V_{n-1}$ are connected to every other vertex, and $V_{n-2}$ is connected to $V_{n-3}$. This graph will take exponential time to solve. Below we provide an example with $n = 5$. This took approximately 125 operations to determine that it was not 3-colorable and so took $T_n = \frac{3^n}{2} \implies T_n \in \Theta \left(3^n\right)$.
