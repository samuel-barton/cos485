\section*{Problem 3}

It is stated that both problem $A$ and problem $B$ are decision problems such that $A \propto B$. It is also stated that $A$ is an NP-complete problem. We are then asked if $B$ is also $NP$-Complete.

We observe that $B$ has two possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $B$ is in $P$. This means $A \propto_T B$, so $B$ is $NP$-hard. This means that $P = NP$, so $B$ is in $NP$.
    \item $B$ is not in $P$. This means $B$ is at least in $NP$. It is stated all problems in $NP$ can be reduced to $NP$-hard problems.
\end{enumerate}

Both of the above indicate that $B$ is an $NP$-complete problem.
