\section*{Problem 4}

We are given a problem as follows, and asked to transform it into a known problem.
\begin{quote}
``Given a list of n positive values, divide them into 2 sublists whose sums are as equal as possible.''
\end{quote}
This problem is most similar to bin packing. 
\\
\\
We set the number of bins $B$ to 2, and limit the capacities of each bin to 
$\frac{S}{2}$ where $S$ is the sum of all of the $n$ positive values. Then the
bin packing algorithm will run until the two bins are packed such that the
sums of each bin are as close to $\frac{S}{2}$ as possible. Also, if the 
capcacity forces bin packing to use a third bin, then up the capcity of the 
two bins and try again.
