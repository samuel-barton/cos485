\section*{Problem 4}

We are given a problem as follows, and asked to transform it into a known 
problem.
\begin{quote}
``Given a list of $n$ positive values, divide them into 2 sublists whose sums are as equal as possible.''
\end{quote}
This problem is most similar to subset sum.
\\
\\
Let $s$ be the sum of the $n$ postive values, and $d_1,d_2$ be the resultant 
sizes of our subsets.
Set the sum limit of our subset to be $\frac{S}{2}$. Execute the subset sum 
algorithm to fill our 
subset as close to $\frac{S}{2}$ as possible. Put all of the remaining items 
into the second subset. 
Since $d_2 \ge \frac{S}{2}$ and $d_1 \le \frac{S}{2}$ and we attempt to make 
$d_1$ as close to 
$\frac{S}{2}$ as possible, we minimize the difference between $d_1$ and $d_2$.
