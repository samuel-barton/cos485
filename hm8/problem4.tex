\section*{Problem 4}

We are given a problem as follows, and asked to transform it into a known problem.
\\
``Given a list of n positive values, divide them into 2 sublists whose sums are as equal as possible.''
\\
This problem is the most similar to bin packing. In the stated problem, bin packing is a arbitrarily large list of values. It is also given $n$ possible bins that the optimal solution will fit into, along with additional bins that non-optimal solutions will overflow into. Given these bins, each having fixed capacities, it will find how to best pack the provided list of elements into these bins. If we set $n=2$, we now have the provided problem.
