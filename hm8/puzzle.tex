\section*{Problem 7}

In this problem we are asked to find a seating arrangement for 150 people at a 
round table such that no two people who dislike one another are forced to sit
adjacent to one another.
\\
\\
For each guest, we know the list of people they quarrel with. Thus, we can 
construct a graph where each node is a person on the guest list, and each edge
represets a person they do not quarrel with. We can determine the edges out of
each node by subtracting the list of people that the person the node represents
quarrels with from the guest list.
\\
\\
With this graph constructed, we then apply the algorithm for the 
\textit{Hamiltonian Circuit Problem} to find a circuit of the graph such that
each person is sitting next to someone they do not quarrel with.
\\
\\
Note: it is possible to construct a graph using these rules for which there is
no Hamiltonian Circuit. This occurs when there is no ordering of guests such
that only non-quarreling guests sit next to each other.
