\section*{Problem 6}

In this problem we are asked to find the minimum number of elements needed to 
force the \textit{Non-increasing First Fit Bin-Packing Algorithm} to fit the
items into three bins when the optimum number is two.
\\
\\
We offer the following solution using six elements.

Given the following set of data: $4,4,3,3,3,3$ the algorithm will pack the 
bins as follows
\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c |}
          & & 3 & &    \\
        4 & & 3 & &    \\
        4 & & 3 & & 3  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Where the optimal backing is 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
        3 & & 3  \\
        3 & & 3  \\
        4 & & 4  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
