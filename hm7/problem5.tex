\section*{Problem 5}

In this problem we are asked to find an O(V + E) algorithm to determine
if some graph is bipartite. First, we assert, as validated by Wikipedia
(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph}), that a graph is 
bipartite if and only if it has no odd length cycles.
\\
\\
Using this we now propose an algorithm to determine if a graph is 
bipartite:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Take one step of depth-first search
    \item Look at the weight of the parent to the current node in the
          search space tree. If the node has no parent, then set its 
          weight to 1. Otherwise set its weight to its parent's weight
          plus 1.
    \item If we find a back edge, then take the difference between the 
          weight of the current node and the node the back edge leads
          to. 
    \item If the difference is even, then there are an odd number of
          nodes in the cycle and we do not have a bipartite graph.
    \item Otherwise, repeat 1-4 until we have gone through all nodes in the 
          graph.
\end{enumerate}
%
This algorithm will have the same time as depth-first search which is \newline
$T_n \in \Theta(V + E)$ assuming that our graph is represented as an adjacency 
list.
