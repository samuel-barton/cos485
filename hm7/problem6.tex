\section*{Problem 6}

In this problem we are asked to find the largest set of disjoint paths
between two verticies in a graph.
\\
\\
The algorithm we propose is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Give each path in the graph a weight of 1
    \item Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between 
          the two target verticies
    \item Remove the edges that consititute the path found in 2, and 
          add the path to the set of disjoint paths between the two 
          verticies
    \item Repeat 1-3 until a path between the two verticies cannot be
          found
\end{enumerate}
%
Now in the worst case, which occurs when the graph is completely 
connected, there will be $V - 1$ paths between the two target verticies.
Since Dijkstra's algorithm takes $T_n \in \Theta(V \, \lg E)$ time at 
each iteration, and there will be $V - 1$ iterations to find all the
paths, then this algorithm will take
$$
T_n = (V - 1) \cdot V \, \lg E \; = \; (V^2 - V) \, \lg E = 
V^2 \, \lg E - V \, \lg E
$$ 
Thus in the worst case the algorithm's time complexity is 
$$T_n \in \Theta(V^2 \, \lg E)$$
