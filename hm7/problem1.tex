\section*{Problem 1}

In this problem we categorize the following sorting algorithms into the
various genres of algorithms discussed in this course.
\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l c p{6cm}}
    \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Technique} & \textbf{Justification} \\
    Insertion sort & Iterative Improvement & Go through each element starting at position 0. Shift all of the elements greater than the current one to the left.\\
    Selection sort & Greedy & Find the minimum value, swap it with the item at position 0.\\
    Bubble sort & Greedy & If the next value is smaller than the current one, swap them.\\
    Quicksort & Divide and Conquer & Divide the problem size recursively, sort at the bottom, then sort on your way up. Note that Quicksort \textit{can} be implemented with a randomized partition.\\
    Merge sort & Divide and Conquer & Divide the problem size recursively, sort at the bottom, then sort on your way up.\\
    Heap sort & Greedy & Larger values go higher (maxheap), or smaller values go higher (minheap)\\
\end{tabular}
