\section*{Problem 2}

In this problem we consider the case of one miserly king who has 
demanded a weighing of $N$ coins with the understanding that one coin
is counterfeit and lighter than the others. 
\\
\\
The algorithm to efficiently solve this is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Divide coins into three parts $A$, $B$, and $C$. $A$ and $B$
          will be divided into problems of size $\floor[\bigg]{\dfrac{n}{3}}$, and the remaining problem of size $\floor[\bigg]{\dfrac{n}{3}} \leq S \leq \ceil[\bigg]{\dfrac{n}{3}} + 1$ are placed in $C$.
    \item Weigh two of the piles.
    \subitem If $A = B$,  then throw out $A$ and $B$ and keep $C$
    \subitem If $A < B$, then throw out $B$ and $C$ and keep $A$
    \subitem If $B < A$, then throw out $A$ and $C$ and keep $B$
    \item Repeat
\end{enumerate} 

In the end, if N wasn't divisible by 3, then we will have either 1 or two extra coins to deal with. In either case, however, continue our process of comparisons until there is nothing left. If the amount is not evenly divisible by 3, we may do 2 more comparisons than normal.
% Is it really 2? 
\\
\\
In the worst case, we do $\ceil[\big]{\log_3(n)} + 1$ comparisons.
