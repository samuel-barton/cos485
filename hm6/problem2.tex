\section*{Problem 2}

In this problem we consider the case of one miserly king who has 
demanded a weighing of $N$ coins with the understanding that one coin
is counterfeit and lighter than the others. 
\\
\\
The algorithm to effeciently solve this is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item divide coins into three parts $A$, $B$, and $C$. $A$ and $B$ 
          are of size $\ceil[\bigg]{\frac{n}{3}}$ and $C$ is of size 
          $\ceil[\bigg]{\frac{n}{3}} + K$ where $K$ is the remainder 
          of $\frac{n}{3}$
    \item 
    \subitem if $A = B$,  then throw out $A$ and $B$ and keep $C$
    \subitem if $A < B$, then throw out $B$ and $C$ and keep $A$
    \subitem if $B < A$, then throw out a and $C$ and keep $B$
    \item repeat
\end{enumerate} 

If $N$ wasn't divisible by 3, then our algorithm will still work as we 
take the ceiling of $\frac{N}{3}$ for the size of each pile.
