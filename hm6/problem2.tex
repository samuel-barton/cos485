\section*{Problem 2}

In this problem we consider the case of one miserly king who has 
demanded a weighing of $N$ coins with the understanding that one coin
is counterfeit and lighter than the others. 
\\
\\
The algorithm to effeciently solve this is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item divide coins into three parts $A$, $B$, and $C$. $A$ and $B$
          to be divided into a multiple of three, and the rest are left
          in $C$ 
    \item weigh two of them
    \subitem if $A = B$,  then throw out $A$ and $B$ and keep $C$
    \subitem if $A < B$, then throw out $B$ and $C$ and keep $A$
    \subitem if $B < A$, then throw out a and $C$ and keep $B$
    \item repeat
\end{enumerate} 

In the end, N wasn't divisible by 3, then we will have either 1 or two 
extra to deal with. If there is one extra, then we do two comparisons. 
If there are two extra left then we still do two comparisons.
\\
\\
In the worst case, we do $\lceil \; \log_3 N \; \rceil + 1$ comparisons.
