\section*{Problem 3}

In this problem we are asked to make a decision tree argument to
determine the absolute lower bound for any algorithm to solve the 
\textit{Miserly King Coin Counterfeit Checking Problem}.
\\
\\
In the problem we are given $N$ coins, and so there are $N$ possible 
solutions to the problem. Each decision we make has three
possible outcomes, so we have a ternary tree. Thus in order to 
determine the minimum possible height of a decision tree with $N$
leaves we must solve the following equation:
\\
$$
N \leq 3^h \implies \log_3 N \leq \log_3 3^h \implies \log_3 N \leq h
$$
\\
Thus we see that there must be at least $\log_3 N$ decisions for any 
algorithm to solve the \textit{Miserly King Coin Counterfeit Checking 
Problem}.
