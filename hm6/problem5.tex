\section*{Problem 5}

To solve this problem, we may reuse our solution to problem 4 verbatim. To reiterate:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create an empty HashMap of the form $K$, $V$ where $K$ is a 
    unique SAT score, and $V$ is the number of occurences of that score.
    \item Iterate over the array. For each element, check to see if it
          is a key in our HashMap.
        \subitem If it is not a key, add it to the HashMap, and set the
                 value to 1.
        \subitem If it is a key, increment the associated value.
    \item Iterate over the keys in the HashMap, and find the key with
          the maximum value. This will be the mode. 
\end{enumerate}

As noted above, this is
$$
    T_n = O(1) + 3n + n \implies T_n \in \Theta(n)
$$
