\section*{Problem 4}
In order to have a worst-case linear algorithm for finding the mode in an array, consider the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create an empty HashMap of the form $K$, $V$ where $K$ is a 
    unique SAT score, and $V$ is the number of occurences of that score.
    \item Iterate over the array. For each element, check to see if it
          is a key in our HashMapy.
        \subitem If it is not a key, add it to the HashMap, and set the
                 value to 1.
        \subitem If it is a key, increment the associated value.
    \item Iterate over the keys in the HashMap, and find the key with
          the maximum value. This will be the mode. 
\end{enumerate}

Our analysis is as follows:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Creation of the \textbf{empty} HashMap is $O(1)$.
    \item Our iteration through the array is $T_n = n$. At each element,
          we perform an $O(1)$ \textit{get} operation. We then perform a
          nother $O(1)$ insertion, whether it be an entry that gets 
          inserted, or an existing value that gets updated. This is a 
          total of $T_n = 3n$
    \item Our linear pass across the set of keys in the HashMap is
          $T_n = k$ where $k$ is the number of unique SAT scores. In 
          the worst case, there are $N$ keys, so we have $k = n$ 
          and $T_n = n$.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, we can express our time complexity as the following:
\\
$$
    T_n = O(1) + 3n + n \implies T_n \in \Theta(n)
$$
